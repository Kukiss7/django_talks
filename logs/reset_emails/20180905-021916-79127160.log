Hi there,

Someone asked for a password reset for the email address 123@123.123.
Follow the link below:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/reset/NQ/4zc-9f4cd73f3ac381de9de7/

In case you forgot your Django Boards username: troll2

If clicking the link above doesn't work, please copy and paste the URL
in a new browser window instead.

If you've received this mail in error, it's likely that another user entered
your email address by mistake while trying to reset a password. If you didn't
initiate the request, you don't need to take any further action and can safely
disregard this email.

Thanks,

The Django Talks Team
